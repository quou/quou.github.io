# Mini Media Library

The goal of creating this library was to learn how something similar to
SDL could be put together. The information I learnt during the creation
of this library was crucial when I was working on the platform layer for
[my current WIP](openmv.html). It uses a custom platform layer with a software
renderer and could be used to create a simple 2-D game in either C or Lua.

It includes the following features:
 - Sprite and font rendering
 - Keyboard and mouse input
 - Windows, POSIX and X11 platform support
 - Image loading
 - Lua binding
