# George Lamb

Home page of George Lamb, student and programmer.

I'm experienced with the following technologies:
 - C (Both ANSI and 99)
 - C++ (Including C++ 17)
 - Lua (The language itself and the C API)
 - Modern OpenGL
 - The Win32 API
 - Xlib
 - GNU/Linux

I enjoy working closely with the operating system and hardware; Using
operating system APIs and direct memory management.
