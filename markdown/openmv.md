# OpenMV

OpenMV started out as an effort to create an open source platform game from the
ground up in C, using nothing but single header utilities and operating system
libraries. Since then, it has grown to become quite a capable box of tools
that would be useful to create a 2-D game, including:

 - Basic Rendering.
 - Resource management.
 - Code hot-reloading for game logic.
 - X11 and Windows support.
 - Physics.
 - Audio.
 - In-game GUI.
 - Debug IMGUI.
 - Save-game system.
 - Room system.
 - Resource Packing.
 - Tilemap system.
 - Dialogue system for NPCs.
 - Scripting language.
 - Post processing.
 - Command system.
