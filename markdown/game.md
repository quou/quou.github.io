# Untitled Game Project

This was a sidescrolling shooter game that me and a friend were working on
for the Australian STEM Video Game Challenge (which is a game jam run through
schools where small teams compete to create a playable game in an engine of choice).
Unfortunately, the jam was cancelled due to Covid-19, so we never finished the game.
We decided to use Godot as our engine of choice, and I did almost all of the
programming and game logic for the game as well as some of the level design.
