# Linkdump

Here's where I put noteworthy links followed by short descriptions so that I might refer back to them later.

## OpenGL
 - [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) - Everybody knows this one.
 - [OGLdev](https://ogldev.org/) - Has a neat CSM tutorial.
 - [docs.gl](https://docs.gl/) - Nice OpenGL API documentation site.

## Vulkan
 - [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) - Learn OpenGL but for Vulkan. Doesn't cover push constants or framebuffers in depth.
 - [Sascha Willems' Vulkan Examples](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) - Vulkan samples showcasing a number of techniques.
 - [Vulkan 1.2 spec](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html)

## General Graphics

Though some might have the name of a graphics API, these are for the most part API-agnostic.

 - [OpenGL Volumetric Lighting](https://github.com/diharaw/volumetric-lighting) - Volumetric Lighting
 - [Voxel-based Global Illumination](https://wickedengine.net/2017/08/30/voxel-based-global-illumination/) - Global illumination as it works in WickedEngine.
 - [PBR book](https://www.pbr-book.org/) - Good resource for PBR.
 - [PCSS soft shadows](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/whitepapers/2008/PCSS_Integration.pdf) - Outlines the implementation of convincing soft shadows.
 - [Realistic soft shadows](https://github.com/aryaman-gupta/Realistic-Soft-Shadows) - Project demonstrating soft shadowing.
 - [Advance Soft Shadow Mapping Techniques](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2008/GDC/GDC08_SoftShadowMapping.pdf) - Presentation about soft shadows.
 - [Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/docs/shadow_PCSS.pdf) - Paper about PCSS.
 - [PCSS](https://github.com/pboechat/PCSS) - PCSS implementation. The code is very weird though.

## Compilers/Interpreters

 - [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) - Book about interpreters.
 - [BYO Lisp](https://buildyourownlisp.com) - Book about building your own Lisp interpreter.
